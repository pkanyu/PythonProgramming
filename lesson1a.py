# This is a comment.
# In python codes starts from the edge, otherwise a syntax error (unexpected indent)
# This is because python is an indented language.
# A function, takes input, processes the input(logic) and generate an output.
# e,g print(), input(), range()...
# Learning a programming language we always follow the following building block:
# 1. Variables: used to store data on a program
# 2. Data Types : Specify the type of data being processed on the program e,g numbers, decimals, letters(Strings), booleans...
# 3. Conditions/Control structures/Decision Making(): Apply the code logic(if, else, else if)
# 4. Loopings /Iterations : Execute the code a number of times depending on the conditions(for loops, while loops)
# 5. Functions


# 6. Object Oriented Programming(classes and objects), e,g Python, Java, JavaScript, C++
#Procedural e,g C
# 7. Exception Handling
# 8. Modules/libraries/Frameworks

# VARIABLES in Python
# Any name that is used to store value in a program, it is created on the left side.
#Assignment : giving a value to a variables we use equal sign(=)
#Declare a variable distance and assign it value 20.9 then output it to the screen.
myname="Erick"
print(myname)
myage = 25
distance=20.9
print(distance)
